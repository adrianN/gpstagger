gpstagger
=========

This is a tool to add GPS data to image files. It reads locations from GPX files and writes the location that is closest to the time a photo was taken into its EXIF data.

It depends on [pexif](https://github.com/EdLeafe/pyexif), [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/), and [gpxpy](https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxpy).
